  
# Weather, Currency Conversion, and Crypto Price Checker



 This Python script allows users to check real-time weather information, convert currencies, and view cryptocurrency prices. The user is prompted to choose between three options:

Weather: Fetches weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Currency Conversion: Converts a specified amount between two currencies using the ExchangeRate-API.

Crypto Price: Displays the current price of a specified cryptocurrency in USD using the CoinGecko API.

The script requires API keys for weather and currency conversion functionalities, which should be stored in JSON files (wea.json for weather API and convert.json for currency API).
